# Sudoku-Solver

23/07/2020: Created new repository from original solver repository.
- Old repo is now home to Backtracking algorithm.
To do:
- ~~Begin stochastic solving algorithm~~
    - ~~Early stage complete.~~
    - ~~Very Important: Adjust genetic algorithm's fitness function~~
    - First version of Genetic Algorithm completed.
        - Solves very (very) easy puzzles
        - Needs work for more difficult puzzles
            - Tournament system will be examined
            - Reproduction system will be examined
            - Mutations will be re-worked
                - ~~It was discovered not all pre-solved integers are preserved in mutation~~
